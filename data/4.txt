Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved over the past few decades, revolutionizing various industries, from healthcare to finance. Initially limited to rule-based systems, AI now encompasses advanced machine learning algorithms that can analyze vast amounts of data and learn from patterns. This evolution has led to significant breakthroughs, such as improved diagnostic tools in medicine and enhanced customer service through chatbots. However, the rise of AI also raises ethical concerns regarding job displacement and data privacy. As society continues to integrate AI into daily life, it is essential to establish guidelines and regulations that ensure the technology is used responsibly and equitably.
