Climate change poses one of the most significant threats to biodiversity worldwide. As global temperatures rise, ecosystems are disrupted, leading to habitat loss and the extinction of various species. Coral reefs, which support a vast array of marine life, are particularly vulnerable to rising ocean temperatures and acidification. Terrestrial ecosystems are not spared either, as changing weather patterns can alter migration routes and breeding seasons for numerous species. Protecting biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem balance and resilience. Conservation efforts must focus on mitigating climate change effects and preserving habitats to ensure that future generations can enjoy the planet's rich natural heritage.
